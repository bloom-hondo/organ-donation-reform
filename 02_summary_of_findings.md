Each year, more than 28,000 viable organs are wasted. Despite scientific
advancements, the organ donation system is held back by poor management and
performance. **The U.S. government could save tens of thousands of lives and
billions of dollars by holding contractors to more rigorous standards and
modernizing the technology** within the organ transplant ecosystem.

---

When people hear “organ donation,” they might only think about a box they
checked off when renewing their driver’s license. While checking that box can be
a helpful first step to saving lives through organ donation, most people don’t
realize that there is a huge ecosystem behind what makes organ transplants
happen — or not happen. People might assume because organ donation is so
important, the system must be well-run. But in reality, it’s not. In fact,
**Americans are unnecessarily losing thousands of lives and billions of taxpayer
dollars each year from what’s broken in this system.**

## The Effects of a Broken System

Today, the medical community continues to make advancements in the field of
organ donation and transplantation. Yet this life-saving science relies on an
outdated system that has failed to scale up to modern day management and
technology best practices.

How does this system hurt Americans? **Imagine you need an organ and manage to
join the 109,000[^1] people on the waiting list -- which in itself can be a
challenge.[^2] Once you're over the hurdle of getting on the list, you have only
a 50% chance of receiving the organ you need within the next 5 years.**[^3]

The problem is even worse for people of color,[^4] who are less likely to get on
the waitlist[^5] and less likely to find a match once they’re on there.[^6]
Black families are also less likely to even be asked about donation -- and face
lower quality interactions when they are approached[^7] -- which contributes to
the low match probability for Black patients.[^8]

One might think with all the people on the waitlist, and with 90%[^9] of
Americans supporting organ donation, that nearly all viable organs from deceased
donors will get used. But disturbingly, that’s not the case. Less than half of
people in the U.S. who meet established criteria for organ donation actually
become donors.[^10]

That means around 28,000 life-saving organs every year, on average, are not
transplanted.[^11]

Additionally, **taxpayers could save $40 billion in 10 years if more organs were
recovered**, according to research.[^12] Without a transplant, patients with
kidney failure have to rely on costly and painful dialysis. Medicare currently
spends $36 billion[^13] every year on dialysis and treatment for people with End
Stage Renal Disease -- which is more than the annual budget for NASA[^14] and
the CDC[^15] combined.[^16]

## Key Findings and Opportunities

After speaking with organ procurement organization (OPO) leaders, transplant
centers, government officials, and other organ donation experts, our findings
reveal a number of critical issues with how the organ transplant system has been
built and continues to run. There are several root causes that illustrate the
need for change.

### A convoluted governance structure leads to problematic oversight

Responsibilities around organ donation and transplantation in the U.S. are
diffused across several different government agencies and contractors
([see “Governance and Oversight in the Organ Donation Process,” Figure 1](#figure-1)),
leading to an unnecessarily complex — and conflicted — structure.

**Figure 1**{:#figure-1}

> ignoring the rot underneath.”

> **- Senior Government Official**

---

When Congress passed the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA) of 1984, the
government established the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN)
and mandated that it be operated by a private contractor. The contract is
currently overseen by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)
under Health and Human Services (HHS). The only contractor who has ever held the
contract is the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS).
([See "Organ Donation Policy," Figure 2.](#figure-2))

**Figure 2**{:#figure-2}
![Image of organ donation policy hierarchy]({{ site.asset_url }}/assets/images/policy-chart.jpg)

[Download the "Organ Donation Policy Chart"
PDF]({{ site.asset_url }}/assets/PDF/Policy_Chart.pdf)

While HRSA is responsible for the regulation and oversight of the OPTN, another
HHS agency, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), is stuck footing the
bill. Government contractors who coordinate organ recovery, known as organ
procurement organizations (OPOs), are 100% reimbursed for all expenses, and
OPOs’ failure to recover enough kidneys contributes to billions each year in
taxpayer dialysis costs. CMS and the OPTN are also both responsible for
overseeing OPOs, which we discuss more below.

Rather than working together to solve problems that arise, the existing
governance structure enables each arm to pass accountability back and forth,
resulting in issues falling through the cracks. As one interviewee explained,
HRSA and CMS tend to pin problems on each other, and rely on the OPTN
contractor, instead of working together to create a cross-HHS solution.

---

> “There's a sensitivity to addressing the controversies because then HRSA has
> to admit that there was a problem there in the first place that they allowed
> [or] didn’t fix. So they point instead to some other problem. It’s a
> conflict-avoidance strategy.”
>
> **- Senior Government Official**

---

The HRSA team assigned to oversee the OPTN contract is roughly 3 1/2 employees.
Since the OPTN is responsible for the technology that connects the organ
transplant ecosystem as well as overseeing the country’s 58 OPOs, it is
concerning that only 3 1/2 employees are tasked with effectively overseeing this
massive responsibility.

### Little accountability contributes to poor performance

OPOs play the vital role of procuring organs, finding a matching recipient, and
delivering those organs to transplant centers for the actual procedure. Each of
the 58 OPOs in the U.S. operate without competition from any other organizations
in their respective regions, effectively making them monopolies. In addition,
there is no standard way that OPOs operate. This leads to a wide variance of
performance — up to a 470% difference between the best and worst OPOs in terms
of potential organs recovered.[^17]

---

> "The greatest gap between where we are and where we wanted to be could be
> covered by having every OPO operate as effectively as the most effective
> OPOs."
>
> **- Former White House Senior Advisor**

---

A recent CMS proposed rule has shown that a majority of OPOs are failing basic
proposed outcome metrics,[^18] resulting in many organs going unrecovered,
mishandled, or even lost. (See
["The Most Frequent Causes of Wasted Organs"](#the-most-frequent-causes-of-wasted-organs))

>
> **- Former U.S. Chief Data Scientist**

---

Despite massive underperformance, no OPO has lost its government contract in the
nearly 40 years the system has operated.

Even though OPOs are technically overseen by the OPTN and CMS, they largely act
unchecked, providing unverified, self-reported data.

>
> **- Association of Organ Procurement Organizations**

---

### Misaligned incentives lead to fewer recovered organs

The current flow of money and costs
([see “Organ Procurement Money Flow,” Figure 3](#figure-3)) between agencies and
federal contractors overseeing organ procurement and placement does not
incentivize getting patients transplants.

**Figure 3**{:#figure-3}
![Image of the organ donation process money flow]({{ site.asset_url }}/assets/images/money-map.jpg)

[Download the "Organ Procurement Money Flow"
PDF]({{ site.asset_url }}/assets/PDF/Money_Map.pdf)

The federal contractor in charge of overseeing the U.S. organ procurement
system, UNOS, earns about $58 million a year, with the bulk of their revenue
coming from transplant centers paying to add patients to the organ waitlist.

---

> “Because most of that money comes from patient fees, there is more of an
> incentive to add patients to the waitlist than to secure organs for
> them.”[^21]
>
> **- New York Times Editorial Board**

---

UNOS has held the contractor position exclusively since 1986. Since that time,
the waitlist has grown considerably.

The current system also does not incentivize OPOs to pursue all donation
opportunities. For example, OPOs may deprioritize “low-yield” candidates, for
lack of either financial or regulatory pressures to recover and place all
transplantable organs. This can result in them rejecting, or simply not showing
up for, older donors with only single organs available[^22] — even though those
single organs could each save a life.

While not all patient referrals are clinically able to become donors, a study
commissioned by HRSA suggests OPOs are only recovering an estimated “one-fifth
of true [donor] potential.”[^23]

---

### **The Most Frequent Causes of Wasted Organs**:

![Image of a hospital worker carrying an organ in a cooler]({{ site.asset_url }}/assets/images/wasted-organs.jpg)

- **Not all potential donor referrals are made.** A referral for a potential
  donor kicks off the whole organ donation process.[^24] Organ procurement
  organizations (OPOs) could work more effectively with donor hospitals to
  ensure all viable patients are referred. Some researchers, however, say OPOs
  avoid this to make their numbers look better. _“Many OPOs have instructed
  hospitals to NOT call on certain patients thus eliminating organ donors before
  they even get to the OPO.” - OPO Leader_

- **OPOs fail to show up or decide not to pursue an organ.** Researchers suggest
  this may happen if an OPO coordinator takes too long to get to the hospital,
  the coordinator or hospital thought the family was unlikely to donate, or it
  was deemed too highly emotional of a case, among other reasons. Too often,
  this involves bias against patients of color.[^25] "_Where OPOs ‘determine’
  eligibility is a HUGE gap in the system. Many OPOs rule out patients that
  could be ruled in. Lack of training/knowledge, preconceived notions, pure
  laziness._" - OPO COO

- **OPOs fail to obtain family authorization.** Many families report they would
  have donated if they had been approached correctly. However, poor interactions
  and poor training contribute to low authorization rates. ”_Training keeps
  getting worse and worse...there's no standard training, it's very subjective….
  They're setting [OPO staff] free before they're really ready."_ - OPO
  Coordinator

- **OPOs do not place organs or get them where they need to be in time.** Once
  an organ is recovered, OPOs rely on an inefficient matching technology from
  UNOS to place the organ while it is still viable. The algorithm can waste time
  by suggesting the wrong offers. For example, 17% of kidney offers go to
  deceased patients.[^26] “_What tends to happen is that sick people get offers
  for organs that they can't tolerate because they're too sick already. They'll
  have too many complications. There IS a patient for that organ, but an offer
  never makes it to a patient who can accept the organ._” - Researcher

### Core technology and software inhibits innovation and organ policy implementation

Many users we talked to stated that UNOS organ transplant technology felt dated
and had frequent periods of downtime, or the system was extremely slow, where
they had to rely on phone calls.

Further, the agency tasked with overseeing OPTN/UNOS has few tech staff to
effectively audit or implement technical best practices. “We don’t have the
in-depth IT staff to have an understanding [of] whether the things [that] are
being built are good,” said one HHS official.

Another issue is the number of disparate software systems within the organ
transplant tech community. Various contractors each handle their own system and
data. This approach prevents a single overseer, like the OPTN, from collecting
centralized data and making smarter, data-driven management decisions.

Most software used by UNOS is considered closed and proprietary, blocking any
chance of innovation or competition from outside actors. **This strongly goes
against modern day best tech practices**. (See ["Tech
Recommendations."]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/Technology)) And it has
caused the organ donation system to miss the mark on moving the technology
forward, blocking out a market of innovative technology options to tackle
solvable problems.

A leading healthcare technology executive described the incumbent’s technology
inner workings as “literally duct tape.”

With the current technology as an inhibitor, trying to implement a new policy
can take over a year -- resulting in lives lost and billions of dollars wasted.

### The government’s current approach to contracting blocks progress

The government (HHS/HRSA) is extremely limited in its ability to select which
vendors can be awarded the OPTN contract, due to overly prescriptive
specifications within NOTA. Thus the same vendor, UNOS, has been awarded the
contract during every recompete for the past 34 years. These constraints limit
progress in developing digital products and services with modern best practices
to truly support the system. (See ["Strategy for Buying OPTN
Tech."]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/Buying-OPTN-Tech/))

Additionally, as mentioned above, in the past 40 years, none of the OPOs in the
U.S. have lost their federally-funded positions, despite clear evidence of
underperformance.[^27]

## Where Do We Go From Here?

The good news is that many of these problems are solvable. We believe it is
within reach to create a system that is less complicated and saves more lives
and taxpayer dollars in the short and long term.

Below are key opportunity areas to increase the effectiveness of the organ
transplant system.

Opportunities to modernize and remove conflicts from governance structure:

- Broaden options for HHS to more freely fulfill organ donation objectives
  without needing to designate as many functions to a contractor, and maximize
  competition for work done by the OPTN, so that HHS can access a much larger
  vendor pool.
- Centralize governance and oversight to contractors working on organ donation
  within one department, and staff it with a digital service team that can
  adequately manage and run technology services.
- Use modern acquisition strategies for technologies related to the OPTN. (See
  [Strategy for Buying OPTN
  Tech]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/Buying-OPTN-Tech).)

Opportunities for CMS to improve accountability in organ recovery and placement:

- Require objective, verifiable, and real-time data from OPOs on the number and
  timeliness of staff follow-up for all eligible donors, and whether follow-up
  was onsite.
- Increase training quality for OPO staff requesting authorization from families
  of donors to include communication best practices, implicit bias, and
  trauma-informed care.
- Include standardized protocols for hospitals on identifying and referring
  potential donors — both donation after brain death (DBD) and donation after
  cardiac death (DCD) cases.

Opportunities for improved technology in organ donation:

- Ensure future OPTN contractors use open-source, cloud-based technology.
  Open-source is essential so the government has flexibility to access and
  refresh all parts of the technology stack.
- Create or require a central data warehouse that enables data-driven decision
  making and more transparent public-facing data, with standardized metrics.
- Improve organ offer technology to ensure all organs find a suitable recipient.
  This improved technology should ensure no offers go to deceased patients. It
  could also include assisted clinical decision making[^28] to help transplant
  centers quickly decide whether to accept.

Medical professionals save nearly 100 lives every day with organ
transplants.[^29] People currently waiting for a heart, lung, kidney, liver, or
pancreas face the painful reality that the science exists to save them, and yet
it’s an outdated, bureaucratic system that’s getting in the way. Employing a few
structural changes could have a massive impact on the number of lives saved.

## Methodology

Bloom Works interviewed more than 30 people within the organ donation system,
including OPO leaders and staff, organ specialist consultants, donor hospital
staff, transplant surgeons, government officials, and researchers. This report
is based on those interviews, case studies, and existing research, as well as
the OPO Best Practices and Tech Recommendations reports compiled by our
researchers.

Research was supported by Arnold Ventures and Schmidt Futures in partnership
with Organize and the Federation of American Scientists.
