## Requirements Document

### Background

A requirements document is a necessary part of a Request for Proposal (RFP). It describes the need. In this case, the need is for modern technology that supports organ donation reform. There are different forms of requirements documents, from less to more prescriptive about what is to be built or delivered under contract. When it comes to buying technology, a government team who is less mature in digital services should especially default to less prescriptive while a more mature team will likely prescribe how the government wants the vendor to work.

A Statements of Objectives (SOO) provides basic, high level objectives of the acquisition and is the least prescriptive choice of a requirements document. It allows industry to re-imagine innovative approaches to achieving the objectives. The SOO opens up the acquisition to a wider range of potential solutions. While the SOO is included in the RFP, it will not be a part of the eventual contract. When vendors submit proposals in response to the RFP, they submit a technical approach in the form of a Statement of Work (SOW) which clearly describes the performance objectives and standards that are expected of the vendor.

## Statements of Objectives

### Product Vision

For donor hospital and transplant center clinicians, organ procurement organizations, researchers and health agencies who need to efficiently and clinically match donor organs with transplant candidate recipients across the nation, and to make continuous improvements to that system the ModernOrganSystem is a matching technology that tracks donor hospital referrals, house recipient candidate information (waitlist), matches organs using clinical algorithms, and logs all transplant outcomes unlike DonorNet our product increases transplants in the US and reduces mortality and costs.

### Objectives

The major objectives to be accomplished include:

1. To capture all relevant data necessary to support the goals and objectives of the OPTN
2. Develop and implement in production organ matching algorithms based on clinical best practices and objective metrics put forth by the OPTN committee
3. Develop applications to support fulfill OPTN key performance indicators such as that 'no organs are lost in transit'
4. Efficiently matching available organs with recipients through an automated process
5. Develop OPTN applications that support equitable allocation of organs regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, pediatrics, and those with increased risk or existing conditions
6. OPTN development adheres to a scrum process of incremental product development driven by human centered research
7. To provide one source of truth for data, owned and accessible by the government, for all of organ transplant
8. Provide necessary organ related data through protected API access that meet minimum SLA standards defined in the QASP
9. To push or allow data access in real time (push data via open API in real time, e.g., to SRTR, HHS, or another third party)
10. To capture a log of all referrals from donor hospitals, even those who do not become donors
11. To minimize account user behavioral bias
12. Follow product development methodologies that use human centered design to ensure organ and OPTN applications are designed with end users and for them
13. To drive the organ donation field forward and help researchers and clinicians build or see insights
