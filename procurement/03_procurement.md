## Draft Request for Proposal

### Background

The purpose of the previous Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) was to provide both coordination efforts as well as a supporting technology solution. The purpose of the OPTN is to coordinate and improve the effectiveness of the nation’s organ procurement, distribution and transplantation systems and to increase the availability of, and access to, donor organs for patients with end-stage organ failure. The OPTN was established pursuant to the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA) of 1984. The functions of the OPTN are described in statute (42 USC 274), and the OPTN final rule (42 CFR 121) provides further clarification of the structure and functions of the OPTN.

Moving away from the previous contracting strategy, this procurement does not include scope for coordination efforts but does include the technology scope previously in the OPTN contract.  This multiple award Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) will conduct the technology operations of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN).

The below reports provide more context about organ donation.

### Introduction

The objective of this procurement is to award a multiple award BPA to provide HHS/HRSA agile product design and delivery services to accomplish the [Statement of Objectives](#implementing-an-acquisition-strategy-focused-on-objectives). While traditional government technology vendors are capable of making nominal improvements (eg. 1.3X) to effectiveness, the government desires vendors that embody the Digital Services Playbook, who are more capable of re-imagining approaches and delivering solutions which improve organ donation effectiveness by orders of magnitude (eg. 10X).

In addition, the government needs a vendor that delivers solutions using modern technology approaches which de-risks the chance of a failed project. The desired vendors use modern technology approaches to learn and pivot rapidly. The government is not interested in a traditional technology vendor that plans to deploy working software 1.5 to 2 years after the award. The government does want a digital services vendor, when combined with the appropriate support from the government, that will deploy working software minimum viable product into production within 6 months of award. Following MVP delivery, the Government desires the product team to continue to iteratively deliver additional functionality (while lowering/maintaining technical debt) that will help solve the problems most important to the end users which were identified most recently.

This effort is consistent with several initiatives to strengthen Federal acquisition and technology practices, such as:



*   **The Digital Services Playbook**, released by OMB in August 2014, as a best practices guide for agencies to use when developing effective digital services; and[^1]


*   **The TechFAR Handbook**, released by OFPP in August 2014, as a guide to the procurement of agile design and development services within the Information Technology (IT) Consulting, IT Outsourcing, and IT Security Categories.[^2]

### Problem Statement

Donor hospitals, transplant center technicians, organ procurement organizations, researchers and health agencies experience difficulty during the organ donation process and are frustrated by:



*   Technical capabilities failures,
*   Lack of clinical agility,
*   A bad user experience,
*   Deficiencies in identifying potential donors,
*   Bias that leads to refusal of viable organs,
*   Organ waste and inefficiencies with transplants not maximized, 
*   Compounding costs


### Product Vision / Scope of Contract

The below product vision is also the overall scope of the contract.

For donor hospital and transplant center clinicians, organ procurement organizations, researchers and health agencies who need to efficiently and clinically match donor organs with transplant candidate recipients across the nation, and to make continuous improvements to that system the ModernOrganSystem is a matching technology that tracks donor hospital referrals, house recipient candidate information (waitlist), matches organs using clinical algorithms, and logs all transplant outcomes unlike DonorNet our product increases transplants in the US and reduces mortality and costs.

*A Cover Page, Table of Contents and/or a glossary of abbreviations or acronyms will not be included in the page count of Volumes I or II. However, be advised that any and all information contained within any Table of Contents and/or glossary of abbreviations or acronyms submitted with an Offeror’s proposal will not be evaluated by the Government.


#### Volume 1- Technical Factor 1 - Case Studies

Offerors shall submit up to three relevant case studies for evaluation. Relevant case studies must demonstrate recent (within the past three (3) years immediately prior to the date of solicitation) performance of tasks related to user research and user story collaboration, agile software development, and DevOps, performed by the Offeror or any proposed major subcontractor.

A major subcontractor is one who is anticipated to be meaningfully used during performance of the task order. Accordingly, Offerors shall sign and submit a certification letter (Attachment 003) with their Case Studies that certifies that the proposed major subcontractor(s) are anticipated to provide support during contract performance and that no consultants were used during the preparation of the Case Studies, nor will they be used for preparation of the Technical Factor 3 Written Technical Approach, nor during a Design Challenge. 

Case Studies may reflect work completed for Government and/or Commercial clients. Offerors shall provide, in addition to the 3 Case Studies, a list of all Major Subcontractors and which of the three (3) aforementioned Functional Areas they will be meaningfully involved with during contract performance (this list will not count against the nine (9) page count). At least one (1) of the three (3) proposed Case Studies must relate to work conducted by the Prime Contractor which must describe work related to one of the three following areas: user research and user story collaboration, agile software development, and DevOps. Additionally, only one Case Study can be from a Large Contractor (as determined by the Small Business Administration for the designated NAICS code for this procurement).

**Offerors must include the following details for each case study submission:**


1. Client organization name
2. Period of performance
3. Offeror’s role for the Case Study (e.g. were you the prime contractor or a subcontractor)
4. Product or project goals, outcomes, and impact
5. Technology Stack (highlighting use of modern or innovative technologies)
6. Delivery Methodology

In addition to the above, Offerors are required to submit Artifacts to further demonstrate their capacity to meet the objectives set forth in the Statement of Objectives using user research and user story collaboration, agile software development, and DevOps. Artifacts can take many formats including but not limited to text files, PDF documents, or image files. Artifacts must be related to the work described in one or more case studies. Artifacts may include client deliverables, code, and/or screenshots. Artifacts must not be created in response to this solicitation, they must be work products generated for the described case study, however, the Offeror may transfer original artifacts to a new format for submission. For example, the Offeror may take a screenshot of a webpage or copy site code into a text file. Artifacts may be anonymized as needed to protect Personally Identifiable Information, Personal Health Information, or other proprietary data, but should still demonstrate the vendor’s expertise as it relates to user research and user story collaboration, agile software development, and DevOps as well as validate the past expertise detailed within the Case Study(s). Artifacts may all be from a single Case Study, or from multiple Case Studies, but there must be at least one artifact specifically related to each of the three (3) following relevant Functional Areas (Offerors shall note in their Case Study submission which artifact(s) are intended to meet each of the three (3) functional areas), with a max of nine (9) artifacts total:



*   **Agile software development**
    *   Developing software in an iterative style following the modern best practices described in the Digital Services Playbook ([https://playbook.cio.gov](https://playbook.cio.gov))
    *   Developing custom software or configurations in a modern software version control system
*   **User research and user story collaboration**
    *   Using a range of qualitative and quantitative user research methods to determine people’s goals, needs, and behaviors
    *   Documenting user research in a form that HHS/HRSA and other contractors can easily access and learn from
    *   Working with the product owner or other HHS/HRSA staff to generate and prioritize user stories based on this research
*   **DevOps**
    *   Continuous deployment of code to testing, staging, and production instances in a commercial cloud environment
    *   Automated testing suite integrated into a continuous integration workflow
    *   Application health monitoring

The Case Studies and their respective artifacts (please include name of case study in the file name along with the name of the respective artifact and do not combine them as each one should stand alone), shall be provided via email to (contract specialist)@___.gov on the due date included in the solicitation. Any explanations related to the artifacts shall be included at the bottom of each case study. On a separate document please submit a list of all major subcontractors regardless of whether they have a case study attributed to them including their DUNS, socio-economic size status, and the Functional Area(s) they are anticipated to support.


#### Technical Factor 2 - Design Challenge

The Design Challenge  will be conducted either in person or remotely. The remote option will use a series of Zoom or Google Meet account meetings hosted by the Government. The exact date, time, and a meeting link will be provided in the advisory notification provided after the evaluation of the Case Studies. The Government will schedule the Design Challenge by drawing lots among those Offerors who elect to proceed after the Technical Factor 1 advisory down-select. The Government will advise Offerors of the date and time of their Design Challenge which is anticipated to be held between (Month Day, Year) and (Month Day, Year). Only employees of the Prime Contractor or a proposed Major Subcontractor (as defined above and as listed in the Case Study Volume) may participate in the Design Challenge.

The goal of the Design Challenge is to evaluate the Offerors’ ability to solve problems using their agile software development approach. Specifically, the Design Challenge will be an opportunity for vendors to demonstrate their abilities in problem definition, user research, development of agile epics/stories, Minimally Viable Product selection, and design iteration/prototyping. Offerors will complete a design sprint including in person or remote agile ceremonies with the Government. Offerors will be given a scenario detailing a fictional government problem and will have six (6) business days to complete the sprint. The following schedule provides the timing of the events during this sprint:

**Business Day 1: Scenario and Test**

The Offeror will join a 15-minute Zoom call to test the technology, during this meeting the Offeror will be emailed, and will then confirm receipt of, the email containing the fictional scenario. This confirmation will constitute the official start time for the Design Challenge. The Offeror will prepare for the Sprint kick-off planning ceremony the following day. Additionally, Offerors will provide the full list of all participants for their Design Challenge, including whether they are from the Prime Offeror or from a Major Subcontractor. Only participants identified on the call may participate in the Design Challenge. This will not be an evaluated step.

**Business Day 2: Sprint Planning**

The Offeror will join a 1-hour Zoom call and conduct Sprint Planning. The Government will provide an actor during this meeting to play the role of the Product Owner for the fictional scenario. During the meeting the Product Owner will be available to answer questions, confirm or refute assumptions, and provide feedback on epics/stories. The Product Owner will be available to the Offeror only during this 1-hour meeting. Following Sprint Planning, the Offeror will carry out the agreed to plan until the Sprint Demonstration and Team Retrospective.

**Business Day 6: Sprint Demonstration and Team Retrospective (Retro)**

The Offeror will join a 2-hour Zoom or Google Meet call and conduct a Sprint Demonstration and Team Retrospective. The Sprint Demonstration will be the first 45 minutes of the meeting. During the Sprint Demonstration, the Offeror will provide a status update including planned epic/story points, completed epic/story points, and notes. The Offeror will demonstrate the epics/stories completed during the sprint. The following 30 minutes will be the Sprint Retrospective (Retro). During the Sprint Retro, the Offeror will collect and discuss feedback from their team about the Sprint. After the completion of the Retro, the Government will take a 15-minute break to discuss the Offeror’s Retro and determine if it has any questions, while leaving the Zoom or Google Meet meeting active and muted. The final 30 minutes of the meeting will be dedicated to Government Question and Answer (Q&A), if any, with the Offeror. These Question and Answer exchanges do not count as discussions.

The Design Challenge is an opportunity for the team to demonstrate the Digital Services including cross-team collaboration, agile methods, user-centered design, and iterative development needed to accomplish the objectives in the Statements of Objectives.

All supporting digital (including any code developed during the Design Challenge, photos, and screenshots) and non-digital artifacts created during the Design Challenge shall be submitted at the end of the Design Challenge; video files will not be accepted. The submission shall be via a private GitHub repository the link to which shall be emailed to (contract specialist@__.gov at the completion of the Design Challenge. The Offeror shall provide the Government GitHub Account [CATCHY PROCUREMENT NAME-Evaluator] access to the private repository. Images of non-digital artifacts created during the Design Challenge can be uploaded to the GitHub repo. These artifacts shall be representative of the Offeror’s proposed process for documenting work. The Government’s confirmation of receipt of the Offeror’s email will constitute the official end of the Offeror’s Design Challenge. Nothing shall have been configured or committed to the GitHub repository provided at the end of the Design Challenge prior to the official start time of the Design Challenge as confirmed by the Government during the Scenario and Test meeting.

PLEASE NOTE: Although major subcontractors are free to partner with more than one prime Offeror, for the Design Challenge, individuals who support one Design Challenge (whether employees of the prime or a subcontractor) must be used on only one prime Offeror’s Design Challenge Team. Accordingly, should there be an individual who supports one prime Offeror’s team that arrives for a second Design Challenge for a different prime Offeror, the Government reserves the right to remove both prime Offerors from further consideration for award. Additionally, all Offerors shall sign and submit the Certification Letter for Design Challenge (Section __ , Attachment __ ) prior to the start of the Design Challenge confirming that there will be no overlap between Design Challenge teams who share a common subcontractor, nor will there be any communication between the two teams at any point during the Design Challenge process. Further, prior to the start of the first 15-minute “Scenario and Test” Zoom (or Google Meet) call to the Design Challenge, all participants will be asked to sign and return the Non-Disclosure Agreement which is set forth in Section __ , Attachment __ of the solicitation at the same time Attachment ___ is submitted.


#### Volume II - Technical Factor 3 - Written Technical Approach

The Written Technical Approach shall be limited to 10 pages, excluding the cover letter and table of contents, and list of acronyms. Within the Written Technical Approach, the Offeror shall provide a detailed approach to the following:



1. How does your organization recruit, hire, and retain talented individuals in the fields of product management, research and design, and software engineering?
2. How does your organization ensure the delivery of quality and consistent design products and functional code?
3. How does your organization foster effective teamwork during agile service delivery?
4. How does your organization collaborate in work environments that involve multiple Government stakeholders and external contractor teams?


#### Volume III - Price

The Offeror is required to complete and submit the Government provided “Price Evaluation Spreadsheet” found as Attachment ___. Instructions for the Spreadsheet can be found in the Worksheet entitled “Instructions.” The Offeror shall input a fully loaded blended labor rate for each labor category that will be valid for the Prime and its subcontractors, as well as a handling rate for Materials and Travel that will become binding ceiling rates for any resultant contract.

Fully loaded labor rates proposed shall be two decimal places.

#### Volume IV - Past Performance

The Offeror is required to submit past performance in organ procurement and transplantation. Note that Offerors who have no relevant Past Performance will receive a neutral score for Technical Factor 4. 


#### Volume V - Solicitation, Offer & Award Documents, Certifications & Representations

_(fill in with appropriate documents related to solicitation, offer and award documents, and certifications and representations)_

Offerors are hereby advised that any Offeror-imposed terms and conditions and/or assumptions which deviate from the Government’s material terms and conditions established by the Solicitation, may render the Offeror’s proposal Unacceptable, and thus ineligible for award.


### Basis for Award

The source selection process for (Catchy Procurement Name) will neither be based on a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable basis nor Tradeoffs. For this effort, the Highest Rated Offerors with a Fair and Reasonable Price will determine the best value basis for the award of contracts under this solicitation.

As there will be no tradeoff between any of the four (4) Technical Factors and Price, there is no relative weighting between the non-Price Factors and the Price Factor. This is because the methodology will evaluate pricing of only those Offerors which achieve the highest technical ratings.

The Government intends to award one task order resulting from the (Catchy Procurement Name) solicitation to one (1) Offeror; however, the Government retains the right to award more than one (1) award should it be determined in its best interest. In the event the Government does decide to award more than one (1) task order resulting from this solicitation, it will award the task order to the next highest ranked Offeror(s). If one (or more) of the Offerors in the top verified ratings (should the Government make additional awards) is found to not have a fair and reasonable price, it will be eliminated from the ranking. No further ranking beyond the awardees will be made.

Any award will be made based on the best overall (i.e., best value) proposals that are determined to be the most beneficial to the Government, with appropriate consideration given to the five following evaluation Factors: Technical Factor 1—Case Studies, Technical Factor 2—Design Challenge, Technical Factor 3—Written Technical Approach, and Price.

Technical Factor 2 is slightly more important than Technical Factor 1, which is significantly more important than Technical Factor 3. Technical Factor 4—Past Performance is far less important than any other Technical Factor (Note that Offerors who have no relevant Past Performance will receive a neutral score for Technical Factor 4). As there will be no tradeoff between any of the four (4) Technical Factors and Price, there is no relative weighting between the non-Price Factors and the Price Factor. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than “Acceptable” must be achieved for Technical Factors 2 and 3 and the Offeror’s Price must be determined Fair and Reasonable. This methodology considers the non-price factors, when combined, to be significantly more important than price.


#### FACTORS TO BE EVALUATED



1. TECHNICAL FACTOR 1— CASE STUDIES
2. TECHNICAL FACTOR 2— DESIGN CHALLENGE
3. TECHNICAL FACTOR 3— WRITTEN TECHNICAL APPROACH
4. TECHNICAL FACTOR 4— PAST PERFORMANCE
5. PRICE


#### EVALUATION APPROACH

All proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions based upon the initial evaluation of proposals. If discussions are entered, they will only be for Technical Factor 3, Price, and/or the Solicitation, Offer; Award Documents, Certification and Representations Volumes as applicable; Offerors are advised they will not be permitted to revise their submitted responses for either Technical Factor 1, Technical Factor 2, or Technical Factor 4 in the event discussions are opened. The proposal will be evaluated strictly in accordance with its written and/or demonstrated content. Proposals which merely restate the requirement or state that the requirement will be met, without providing supporting rationale, are not sufficient. Offerors who fail to meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation in Technical Factors 2 and 3 will be rated Unacceptable and thus, ineligible for award. **Offerors who have no relevant Past Performance will receive a neutral score for Technical Factor 4.**


#### TECHNICAL EVALUATION APPROACH

The evaluation process will consider the following:


* **TECHNICAL FACTOR 1 - CASE STUDIES**  
  
  Technical Factor 1 shall evaluate the Government’s confidence in the Offeror’s ability, as evidenced by the past experience and expertise identified within each Case Study, as well as all artifacts provided with the Case Studies, to accomplish the objectives set forth in the Statements of Objectives. Although there is no specific rubric for evaluation of Case Studies, the provided artifacts will be evaluated based on how well they align with the narrative description provided for their respective case study, the technical quality of the artifact, and the appropriateness of the artifact to the functional area to which it is being proposed.  
  
  After the Government completes evaluation of the Technical Factor 1-Case Studies, the highest rated Offerors will receive an advisory notification advising them to proceed to Technical Factors 2 and 3. Lower rated Offerors will be advised they are unlikely to be viable competitors. The intent of this advice is to minimize proposal development costs for those Offerors with little chance of receiving an award. However, the Government’s advice will be a recommendation only, and those Offerors may elect to continue their participation in the acquisition. All Offerors who elect to continue their participation shall provide notification no later than 5PM ET the next business day to HHS/HRSA after which they will be provided the dates and times for the Design Challenge and the due dates for the Written Technical Approach, Price, Offer & Award Documents, Certifications & Representations Volumes.


* **TECHNICAL FACTOR 2 – DESIGN CHALLENGE** _AND_ 
* **TECHNICAL FACTOR 3 - WRITTEN**
  
  TECHNICAL APPROACH: The evaluation of Technical Factor 2-Design Challenge and Technical Factor 3-Written Technical Approach will consider the following:

  1. **Understanding of the Problem** – Technical Factor 2 and Technical Factor 3 will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the Offeror’s approach demonstrates a clear understanding of all features involved in solving the problems and meeting and/or exceeding the requirements presented in the solicitation and the extent to which uncertainties are identified and resolutions proposed.
  
  2. **Feasibility of Approach** – Technical Factor 2 and Technical Factor 3 will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the proposed approach is workable and the end results achievable. They will be evaluated to determine the level of confidence provided the Government with respect to the Offeror’s methods and approach in successfully meeting and/or exceeding the requirements in a timely manner.


* **TECHNICAL FACTOR 4 – PAST PERFORMANCE**
  
  The evaluation of Technical Factor 4-Past Performance will consider the information obtained from the awards and references provided in the offeror’s responses to the RFP, information from [www.cpars.gov](www.cpars.gov), information from other customers known to the Government, and other sources who may have useful and relevant information. Evaluation of past performance may be quite subjective, based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. Note that Offerors who have no relevant Past Performance will receive a neutral score for Technical Factor 4.


#### PRICE/COST EVALUATION APPROACH

This evaluation will not result in a Total Evaluated Price. Proposed prices, including all proposed fully burdened Labor Rates, Material Handling Rate, and Travel Handling Rate, will only be evaluated to determine that the proposed Rates are fair and reasonable. Additionally, only Offerors determined to be the highest technically ranked will have their price proposals evaluated. The fair and reasonable evaluation of rates will be used to establish Maximum Rates on awarded call orders. Such Maximum Rates will apply to Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) orders and Time-and-Material/Labor-Hour orders, however, on FFP orders Offerors may propose other Labor Categories when that labor rate is not on contract. Additionally, Offerors shall propose a handling rate to be applied to Materials and Travel which will be incorporated into any resultant contract as a ceiling rate.

For each proposed fully burdened direct labor rate, the basis for the proposed maximum fair and reasonable rates (Attachment 001, column I), used as the basis for comparison, will be labor rates found in the GSA CALC Tool for the Labor Categories included in the attachment. Failure to provide a rate for each listed Labor Category in Attachment 001 may render the Offeror’s price proposal inadequate and preclude the Offeror from further consideration for award. The Government has established Interquartile Ranges based on the labor rates found in the GSA CALC Tool and then applied the Tukey Rule to establish the maximum rates used as the basis for comparison and included in Attachment 001. The proposed fully burdened Labor Rate for each Labor Category listed in the Price Evaluation Spreadsheet, Attachment 001, will be compared to the “maximum fair and reasonable labor rate” listed in column I of Attachment 001. to ensure it does not exceed the maximum rate. As long as all rates are at or lower than the maximum rate for each Labor Category, the proposed rates will be determined fair and reasonable. Should a single proposed rate exceed the listed maximum rate in any Labor Category, the Government reserves the right to determine the Offeror’s entire Price Proposal to be not fair and reasonable and remove the Offeror from further consideration for award.
