## Overview of Acquiring Digital Services for the OPTN


The life-saving system of organ donation and transplantation in the U.S. is coordinated through the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) contract with the federal government. For more than thirty years, this contract called for competencies in both the coordination of the organ donation and transplant ecosystem, and also critical support for the technologies that underlie the system.

The current procurement processes in place hamper the government's ability to truly support organ donation reform and do not reflect procurement best practices. The following documents outline the problems in previous and current OPTN procurements and offer recommendations to support a new approach for buying digital services. A contract with a vendor that delivers digital services that embodies modern procurement practices could indeed translate into saving more lives and taxpayer dollars.

### BACKGROUND & METHODOLOGY

Bloom Works was brought in to conduct research around the processes, systems, and technology on which the organ transplant system has been built and continues to run. We interviewed more than 30 people within the organ donation system, including OPO leaders and staff, organ specialist consultants, donor hospital staff, transplant surgeons, government officials, and researchers. We also interviewed digital service vendors who offered special insight into procurement and technology best practices. This report is based on those interviews, case studies, and existing research, as well as the OPO Best Practices and Tech Recommendations reports compiled by our researchers.
